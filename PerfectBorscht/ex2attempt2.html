   <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melt the butter in a large
     <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp pan, and then soften

      <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 10 minutes, adding a little
      <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp stock if the vegetables begin
      <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp to look dry. Meanwhile,

    <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp then add the cabbage, garlic
    <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and grated beetroot. Cook until
    <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp all the vegetables are tender
    <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (about 10 minutes).

  <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp then serve with a dollop of
  <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp sour cream, a sprig of dill, and
