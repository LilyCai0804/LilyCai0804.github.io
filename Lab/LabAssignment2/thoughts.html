<p>When I was in class last Friday, to be honest everythng about Javascript confused me, even though I've learned a bit about it last semester.
    <br>I was afraid that I might not even know where to start for this assignment.
  <br>
  Fortunately, I understand how to use Javascript much better thanks to w3schools.
  <br>For this assginemnt, I didn't really style the page, instead I focused on the interaction.
 <br>I used onmousemove and onclick events. I have also played around with mouseup and mousedown, but the effects they create are very similar to that of onclick.
  <br>I wanted to use the copy event to style texts such as changing background colors, but it seemes like it only works for input and textarea.
  <br>For the quote, my original idea was to click on the quotation marks to reveal the actual text within them, but eventually I couldn't come up with an idea way to do it.
