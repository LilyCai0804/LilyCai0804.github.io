<p>To 🐯
<br>You might already know what's going on here...
<br>Thank you for showing me EVERY side of you over the past year.
<br>YOU GUYS add colors to my life. And burps. And some farts.Yes, they are COLORFUL and PRECIOUS.
<br>It has been a difficult time, but the year to follow will be filled with joy, because you DESERVE it.
<br>I hope your birthday is as sweet and special as YOU are.
<br>HAPPY 22ND BIRTHDAY my best friend forever! Lots of love.
<br>From 🦁
