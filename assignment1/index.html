<p id="quote">"Does this recipe work in this format?<br>
What is the trade-off for convention and novelty here?<br>
Are there some types of recipes that work better one way than another?<br>
What does it mean for a recipe to work? What other kinds of rules and instructions follow these kinds of structural conventions?<br>
What would it mean if a recipe was a conversation?<br>
Or IKEA instructions?<br>
Or like a table with chairs around it, indicating where you should sit?"</p>
  <br>
  <br>
It’s a very standard recipe. I think letting people understand what they should do and be willing to take actions is the most important function of a recipe.
<br>In order for a very basic recipe to work, I prefer arranging information in categories with logic, rather than narratives.
<br>However, sometimes following a random and even poetic recipe to cook is fun for me, especially when I’m not in a rush.
<br>When I cook, I like to have the right ingredients required for a specific instruction next to me when I am following this step.
<br>To transform this way of cooking into the layout of a recipe, I played around with grouping together a step and the ingredients needed for it.
