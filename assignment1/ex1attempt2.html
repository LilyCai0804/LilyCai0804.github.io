     <li><p><em>Cut</em> 3/4 of the peeled beetroot into small dice (you may want to wear rubber gloves to do this) and set the rest aside. <em>Melt</em> the butter in a large pan, and then <em>soften</em> the onion over a gentle heat for 5 minutes.</p></li>
   <li><p><em>Add</em> the carrot, leek, celery, diced beetroot, allspice and bay leaf and stir well to coat with butter. <em>Cook</em> for another 10 minutes, <em>add</em>ing a little stock if the vegetables begin to look dry. Meanwhile, <em>grate</em> the remaining beetroot.</p></li>
   <li><p><em>Pour</em> in the rest of the stock and the potatoes and simmer for 15 minutes, then <em>add</em> the cabbage, garlic and grated beetroot. <em>Cook</em> until all the vegetables are tender (about 10 minutes).</p></li>
  <li><p><em>Add</em> the vinegar, sugar, pepper and a pinch of salt and taste. <em>Add</em> a little more of any of these if necessary, then <em>serve</em> with a dollop of sour cream, a sprig of dill, and some Polish bread on the side.</p></li>
