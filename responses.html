  <br>Metaphors We Live By &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lakoff and Johnson
  <p>It reminds me of something similar in “This Typeface is Changing Your Life” by Leslie Savan. It’s an article about the influences of Helvetica. Although this typeface appears to be very subjective and neutral, what it contains is more than pure letters. Like a metaphorical concept, we feel power, authority and calmness when we look at words that are set in this specific typeface.
<br>
<br>“Our concepts structure what we perceive, how we get around in the world, and how we relate to other people”. I suppose that, it explains why I feel that the world I live in is so different from ones people around me live in. I guess I could reflect what the world looks for me through my personal homepage.
<br>
<br>According to the text, our concept controls our activities in real life, which then shapes our languages. The metaphor system is a universal language that has been in our subconscious. The different ways we use languages on our webs could therefore reflect a concept, our personal values or even (sub)culture identities.

<br>Metalogue: Why a Swan? &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gregory Bateson
 <br>
<br>Holding this idea of metalogue in mind, we are most helpful when we draw attention to the form of the conversation: the language that is used, the patterns that emerge between individuals, the assumptions, beliefs and feelings that are implicit in what we say. People could start to notice what they mean, the assumptions that lie behind what they mean and the assumptions they make about what others mean and how their relationships with others are reflective of this process.
<br>
<br>Similar to what I get to know from the other text, we could think about different techiniques to construct a certain conversation, a mental set that we want the users of our websites to experience.

  <br><a href="http://craigjackson.io">Craig Jackson</a>'s Personal Homepage
  <p>My first impression on this personal website is that it is minimal and playful at the same time. The animation of the game has a strong visual impact.
The switch between a pink cap and a keyboard emoji as the cursor breaks the rigidity. The content displayed is also extremely straightforward.
His introduction are simply three paragraphs without any special edition.
It is kind of odd that there aren’t any visual representation of his work on his website.
I spent a lot of time trying to find any hidden buttons to his projects.
<br>
<br>At first, I was focusing on the information of the designer displayed on the right part of the page. When I finished reading, obviously the game on the left has already finished, showing me with “type your name”. I was just very confused.
<br>
<br>However, I feel like Craig Jackson is very confident. His personal website serves as a platform for users  to relax, instead of just looking at his work. One of the reasons that I picked this site is that it is not truly functional, which makes it outstanding.
When I think about my personal homepage, one of my concerns is how to organize and present my work and blend the presentation into my whole website.
Now it just makes me think about if i should post everything about me on the web. Sometimes, people don’t only want to know others, they want some fun instead.
Anyway, the game he designed for his personal homepage actually becomes his finest work to reveal his creativity and personal style.
